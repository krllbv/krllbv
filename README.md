### Hello there!

My name is Kirill, and I am junior data analyst. After completing my university studies, I chose data analysis as my long-term career path.
I learned some analytical tools during my university education, such as Power BI and Tableau, as well as the basics of statistics. However, I had to explore some fields on my own.
Over the past six months, I have actively studied Python for data analysis and automation of routine tasks. I have practiced writing SQL queries and have also learned methodologies of A/B tests.
To improve my knowledge and gain practical skills, I have completed Karpov.Courses such as "Simulator of an Analyst" and "Simulator of SQL." During these courses, I worked with real products, conducted analysis of operational metrics, and investigated the causes of data anomalies.

At present, I have a confident level of expertise in working with:
           ♦SQL queries of varying complexity, 
           ♦conducting A/B test analysis, 
           ♦automating reporting using Airflow, 
           ♦using Git through the command line, 
           ♦building ETL pipelines.
Here, you can find some of my projects and see how I work with data.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to the opportunity for future collaboration!
