### Hello there!

### About me:
My name is Kirill, and I am junior data analyst. After completing my university studies, I chose data analysis as my long-term career path.
I learned some analytical tools during my university education, such as Power BI and Tableau, as well as the basics of statistics. However, I had to explore some fields on my own.
Over the past six months, I have actively studied Python for data analysis and automation of routine tasks. I have practiced writing SQL queries and have also learned methodologies of A/B tests.
To improve my knowledge and gain practical skills, I have completed Karpov.Courses such as "Simulator of an Analyst" and "Simulator of SQL." During these courses, I worked with real products, conducted analysis of operational metrics, and investigated the causes of data anomalies.

At present, I have a confident level of expertise in working with:<br>
          ♦SQL queries (joins, CTE, window functions),<br> 
          ♦conducting A/B test analysis,<br> 
          ♦automating reporting using Airflow,<br> 
          ♦using Git through the command line, <br>
          ♦building ETL pipelines.<br>
Here, you can find some of my projects and see how I work with data.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to the opportunity for future collaboration!
